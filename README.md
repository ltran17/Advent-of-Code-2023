# Advent-of-Code-2023

My goal for this year is to earn 25 of 50 possible stars. Seems reasonable? 

## Things I've learned about my coding:
* I don't like clutter. Instead of copying in the `get_lines` function I defined in cell on Days 1 and 2, I put the function in a utilities.py file and imported it. Much better!
* TBD

## Stars earned (as of 12/2): 4

## Day 01: ðŸŒŸ ðŸŒŸ

* Ugh slicing strings! I'm sure there is a prettier way to accomplish this. Finally got the second star. 
* ~~I ran into parsing trouble, but I'm not sure what the solution is (yet). Will probably come back to it. Will think on it.~~

## Day 02: ðŸŒŸ ðŸŒŸ

* The most challenging aspect was parsing the input.
* Daily use of pandas made this a straightforward solve to earn both stars
