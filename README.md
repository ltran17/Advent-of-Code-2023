# Advent-of-Code-2023

My goal for this year is to earn 25 of 50 possible stars. Seems reasonable? 

## Things I've learned about my coding:
* I don't like clutter. For Day 3, I put the `get_lines` function utilities.py file to import. Much better than the copy-paste solution from Days 1 and 2.
* When I first started AoC, Python (and thinking like a coder) was as much of a challenge as anything. Four years later, I am more fluent and the coding feels more fluid, so I can spend more time on the mathematical puzzle part of the challenge. Sometimes.

## Stars earned (as of 12/6): 10

## Day 06: ðŸŒŸ Wait for It
* Ah, finally a day where the parsing is easy, and so is the problem! Part 1 with brute force. Just waiting for the other shoe to drop.

## Day 05: ðŸŒŸ If You Give a Seed a Fertilizer
* Again, the hardest part was parsing! I was having a tough time getting the processing to move on to the next category once the location changed. I did some gymnastics to make it work. Not so pretty.
* For part 2, brute force is not going to work. I need to think about how to solve it.

## Day 04: ðŸŒŸ ðŸŒŸ Scratch Cards
* First star is straightforward: used lots of built-in Python capabilities with string parsing and list comprehensions
* Second star had the potential to be a real PITA, but I slowed down and figured out exactly the algorithm -- thankfully there was no need for recursion, just normal ol', nested for loops.

## Day 03: ðŸŒŸ ðŸŒŸ Gear Ratios
* I remember similar problems in past years where we had to check values "around" other values in an array. This year my solution feels more natural than in the past -- my implementation is less baroque, more straightforward. Perhaps I've matured as a programmer.
* Off by one errors...sigh
* My original thought was to parse the lines into a dataframe but reconsidered. Used regex and named tuples in the solution.
* The named tuple in part 1 came in handy for part 2. I figured out my algorithm while I was on a walk. I hope my solution is readable to future me.

## Day 02: ðŸŒŸ ðŸŒŸ Cube Conundrum

* The most challenging aspect was parsing the input.
* Daily use of pandas made this a straightforward solve to earn both stars

## Day 01: ðŸŒŸ ðŸŒŸ Trebuchet

* Ugh slicing strings! I'm sure there is a prettier way to accomplish this. Finally got the second star. 
* I ran into parsing trouble, ~~but I'm not sure what the solution is (yet). Will probably come back to it. Will think on it.~~
