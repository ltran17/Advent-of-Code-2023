# Advent-of-Code-2023

My goal for this year is to earn 25 of 50 possible stars. Seems reasonable? 

## Things I've learned about my coding:
* TBD

## Stars earned (as of 12/2): 3

## Day 01: :star2: 

* I ran into parsing trouble, but I'm not sure what the solution is (yet). Will probably come back to it. Will think on it.

## Day 02: :star2: :star2:

* The most challenging aspect was parsing the input.
* Daily use of pandas made this a straightforward solve to earn both stars
